      <description>Grand Slam Tennis Bar Chart Race Awhile back, I put together a tutorial for a barchart race using gganimate. Folks still seem to visit the post so I wanted to clean that up a bit as I&amp;rsquo;m putting together my new site. The original was inspired by a Tidy Tuesday exercise and some work John Burn-Murdoch had done with bar chart races in D3. This will follow the original extremely closely, but hopefully look a little better for the new site.</description>
